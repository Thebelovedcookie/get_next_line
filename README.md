It was my third project. I was proud of myself, thinking I knew a lot about C.

Whether it was a file, stdin, or even a network connection later on, I always needed a way to read content line by line.
It was time to start working on this function, which would be essential for my future projects.

In this project, I learned how to deal with linked list, that was really hard to understand the concept, but once i got it, it was much more easier than use array.
I also learned few things about file descriptors, but that was only the beginning of my discovery.
I could never have imagined what was coming next.
